# Introduction to InSpec

[InSpec](http://inspec.io/) is an open-source testing framework for infrastructure with a human-readable language for specifying compliance, security and other policy requirements. Easily integrate automated tests that check for adherence to policy into any stage of your deployment pipeline.

During this session, participants will:

* Run InSpec locally on a machine
* Run InSpec on a remote machine
* Use InSpec in the Chef cookbook development process for integration testing
